Aiyoh… these birds ah, so noisy every morning, not even let one old lady sleep longer a bit 
Mynah outside, coo-coo, chit-chit, like got big announcement, like Prime Minister want to speak
Where my specs go ah? 
These eyes, not so sharp like last time
Ah, there you are. Always run and hide in the night
Hah, good morning, mynahs
You all very hardworking, eh? 
Don’t know what you all talk about every morning, but so steady one, chit-chit, never miss a day
Better than some people lah

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Morning, Ma 
You wake up just in time – breakfast is ready!
Your favorite, kaya toast, and kopi, no sugar
Doctor say must watch the sugar, remember?

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Ah Boon, so good, ah?
So busy but still make breakfast for me
Aiyoh, like got my own butler already

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Yah lah, butler duty today
But I need to go soon, boss want me to open shop already
You got remember the schedule for the week or not?
Today is Tuesday, so after breakfast, you have your morning exercise with Auntie Siew Fong
Just a little tai chi, ah? Don’t try to become a kung fu master, okay?

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Tai chi only, don’t worry lah
But can still show Auntie Siew Fong a few moves, maybe

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Okay, Ma, Wednesday morning, don’t forget today’s mahjong with Auntie Siew Fong and the gang!
Better be careful – I heard they’re fierce, ah!

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Fierce, ah? Those aunties – really like they got x-ray vision, can see my tiles! But never mind, they can try, this week I got strategy

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Eh, don’t go betting your kopi money, okay?

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Aiyah, small stakes only! Just enough for one kopi if I win, maybe one extra kaya toast if I’m lucky

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
By the way, you remember they’re playing at the Community Centre this week, right? 
Auntie Siew Fong’s house is still undergoing renovation

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Oh yes, yes! That’s right, the CC this week, almost forgot
Poor Siew Fong, all that noise and dust, good thing we have the CC

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
And Ma, don’t forget to take your medication every day, okay? 
The pink and green in the morning, the blue and yellow at night 
Green and blue everyday ah, pink on tuesday and thursdays, and yellow every monday wednesday and friday

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Aiyah, I know, I know lah 
Don’t need to nag me so much, I’m not a blur sotong

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Not sotong lah, just making sure! 
I know sometimes you get busy with Auntie Leela or mahjong, then can forget 
So, today’s Tuesday, remember? 
Green capsule and pink tablet in the morning, then blue at night

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Yes, yes… see? Can remember! Green and pink this morning, blue later 
But if I forget, you must remind me on Friday when you come, okay?

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Deal! But I want to see you keep that memory sharp, Ma 
Just look at the labels in the kitchen each morning – easy-peasy, no need for me to nag

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Okay lah, I’ll check, I’ll check
But don’t worry so much; this brain still got some power!

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
And Friday night, we’re coming over with the kids for dinner, okay? 
You got your famous curry recipe ready?

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Of course! The best curry this side of Singapore, you know
They don’t come for my company, they come for the food, I know 
But don’t worry, I put extra love inside also

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Ma, can taste the love, right? 
Okay, looking forward to it! 
Just don’t make it too spicy, later the kids cannot eat

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Ah Boon, curry must have kick, you know? 
Otherwise, what’s the point! 
But okay lah, I go easy – make it ‘family-friendly’

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Oh, Ma, one more thing – I won’t be able to follow you to the clinic on Wednesday to pick up your medicine 
Boss needs me at work, so can’t take the time off this week

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Aiyoh, so busy, ah? Never mind, lah, I can manage on my own 
Just go in, see doctor, and take my medicine, right?

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Yes, but make sure you get everything the doctor says, ah? 
And ask the nurse to write down any new instructions if you’re not sure

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Aiyah, don’t worry. I’ve been to the clinic more times than you’ve had birthdays, you know, I’ll remember everything

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Okay, okay, just making sure! 
And remember, green and pink pill in the morning and blue one at night – everything’s still in the kitchen to keep it easy

#speaker: Mother #portrait:Happymother
Yes, yes, I know, you go settle your boss – I can handle myself! 
And don’t be surprised if I come back with extra mangoes from the market after

#speaker: Son #portrait:HappySon
Alright, Ma, just don’t carry the whole market back! 
I’ll see you Friday for dinner, then
-> END
