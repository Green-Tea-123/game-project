That was some nice breakfast
Alright, need to make beef curry for today
Let’s see what’s in here… onions, garlic… ah, still got some potatoes
Aiyoh, no carrots… and need cardamom too – can’t forget that, otherwise, no fragrance
And beef chuck! How can make beef curry without beef, Ah Mui?
Must be getting blur, better go to the market and get what’s missing
And need to remember to take my meds
