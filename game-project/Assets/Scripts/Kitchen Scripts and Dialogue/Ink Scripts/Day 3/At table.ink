Lucky my food is still good
Ah Seng… this old lady misses you sometimes, you know?
Just the simple things, like that fried rice of yours
Alright, that’s enough for tonight. This old lady needs her rest…                    tomorrow’s another day right?........
....Goodnight, Ah Seng. Better luck tomorrow....
