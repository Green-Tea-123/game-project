Wah, so tired today
Just put the rice in the pot and rest
#speaker: Mother #portrait:Sadmother
Sometimes… just wish he was still here, lah
When I was tired like this, he’d whip up a simple fried rice in no time
Nothing fancy, just rice, egg, and a bit of soy sauce
 Said it was his ‘secret recipe'
 My food is ready, lets bring them to the table to eat
